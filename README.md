# ece-143-final-project
Repository that contains all of our code for ece-143

ece143_grp12_final.py contains the final .py file that contains all our code. 

The first part of the file goes into datasets/san_diego_listings.csv and it cleans up the csv file and spits out cleaned san_diego_listing_cleaned.csv
The second part of the code does data analysis on the cleaned up csv file and then produces graphs

The modules we are using in our code are : 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from functools import reduce
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
